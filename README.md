Team member: Dada Zhang, 

This python script is used for performing k-means algorithm. Download 'kmeans_algorithm.py' file and iris.arff data to implement this program.

Dataset: 
- iris.arff (sourced from Kaggle website)
- It is popular and well known flower dataset for classification

Implementation:
- !python kmeans_algorithm.py [iris.arff] [k] [epsilon] [iterations]
- !python kmeans_algorithm.py iris.arff 3 0.0001 100

Results:
- Final cluster centroids, final SSD, total number of iterations
- Plot of runtime vs. number of clusters
- Plot of runtime vs. number of dimension
- Plot of runtime vs. size of dataset (number of transactions)

WeKa_Output
- The results of k-means are saved in Weka_Output folder.
- Number of clusters is from 1 to 10
